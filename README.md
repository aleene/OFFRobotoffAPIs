#  OFFRobotoffAPIs

This is an demonstration app for the various Folksonomy API's of Open Food Facts.

## Robotoff
Robotoff provides a simple API allowing consumers to fetch predictions and annotate them. Robotoff can interact with all Openfoodfacts products: Openfoodfacts, Openbeautyfacts, etc. and all environments (production, development, pro).

## Demo
The demo application allows you to see the results of API-calls.

## Installation
You can reuse the libraries from this repository. The steps:
- OFF-folder - all the files in this folder should copied.
- RBTF-folder - copy only the files for the API's that you are going to use.

## Usage
### Initialisation

### Product API.

Function which retrieves the possible questions for a specific product.
```
func RBTFQuestionsProduct(with barcode: OFFBarcode, count: Int?, lang: String?, completion: @escaping (_ result: Result<RBTF.QuestionsResponse, RBTFError>) -> Void)
```
**Parameters**
- offbarcode: the OFFBarcode for the product;
- count: the maximum numer of questions to be retrived for this product. If not specified the value is 1;
- lang: the language code for the question and possible answer. If not specified en is assumed (english);

**Returns**
A completion block with a Result enum (success or failure). The associated value for success is a RBTF.QuestionsResponse struct and for the failure an Error.

### Insights random API
Function to retrieve a random insights with a list of query parameters to filter the questions
Declaration
```
func RBTFInsights(insightType: RBTF.InsightType?, country: String?, valueTag: String?, count: UInt?, completion: @escaping (_ result: Result<RBTF.InsightsResponse, RBTFError>) -> Void)
```
Not all possible query parameters have been implemented, as they are not useful to everyone (server_domain, campaign, predictor).
** Parameters **
- insightType: filter by insight type
- country: filter by country tag
- valueTag:filter by value tag
- count: the number of questions to return (default=1
** Returns **
A completion block with a Result enum (success or failure). The associated value for success is a RBTF.InsightsResponse struct and for the failure an Error.

### Insights barcode API
Function to retrieve a random insights with a list of query parameters to filter the questions
Declaration
```
func RBTFInsights(barcode: OFFBarcode, insightType: RBTF.InsightType?, country: String?, valueTag: String?, count: UInt?, completion: @escaping (_ result: Result<RBTF.InsightsResponse, RBTFError>) -> Void)
```
** Parameters **
- barcode: barcode for which this insights are sought (required)
- insightType: filter by insight type
- country: filter by country tag
- valueTag: filter by value tag count: the number of questions to return (default=1

Not all possible query parameters have been implemented, as they are not useful to everyone (server_domain, campaign, predictor).
** Returns **
A completion block with a Result enum (success or failure). The associated value for success is a RBTF.InsightsResponse struct and for the failure an Error.

### Insights detail API
Function to retrieve the details of a specific insight
```
func RBTFInsights(insightId: String, completion: @escaping (_ result: Result<RBTF.Insight, RBTFError>) -> Void)
```
** Parameters **
- insightId: the id of an insight
** Returns **
A completion block with a Result enum (success or failure). The associated value for success is a RBTF.InsightsResponse struct and for the failure an Error.

### Predict category API
Function to predict categories for a product

```
func RBTFPredictCategoriesProduct(barcode: OFFBarcode, deepestOnly: Bool?, threshold: Double?, predictors: [RBTF.Predictors]?, completion: @escaping (_ result: Result<RBTF.PredictResponse, RBTFError>) -> Void)
```

** Parameters **
- barcode: the barcode of the product to categorize
- deepestOnly: if true, only return the deepest elements in the category taxonomy (donâ€™t return categories that are parents of other predicted categories)
- threshold: default: 0.5; The score above which we consider the category to be detected
- predictors: Array Predictors (Enum): .neural and/or .matcher; List of predictors to use, possible values are matcher (simple matching algorithm) and neural (neural network categorizer)

** Returns **
A completion block with a Result enum (success or failure). The associated value for success is a RBTF.PredictResponse struct and for the failure an Error.

## Results
The API-calls can produce multiple positive (code 200) results jsons.

### QuestionsResponse json
The results can be either positive (one or more questions), or negative (no questions).

#### Positive result
If the API-call results in one or more questions, the following example json. In this json the **status**-field has the value **found**:
```
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "barcode": "4056489098683",
      "type": "add-binary",
      "value": "Chocolade koekjes",
      "question": "Behoort het product tot deze categorie?",
      "insight_id": "4e11070b-f15c-433a-869c-7e4b3facae25",
      "insight_type": "category",
      "value_tag": "en:chocolate-biscuits",
      "source_image_url": "https://static.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/405/648/909/8683/front_de.33.400.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "status": "found"
}
```
The **questions**-field contains an array of questions, with the following fields for each question:
- barcode: the barcode of the product (String with only numerical fields);
- type: the question type, add-binary is a true/false/skip question;
- value: the possible answer for the question (a user can confirm, abstain or deny) in the language specified in the API-call;
- question: The question that can be presented to the user in the language specified in the API-call;
- insight_id: the id for this question, which must be used as reference for further API-calls;
- insight_type: the subject of the question (in this case the category of the product);
- value_tag: the canonical value of the possible answer in the taxonomy;
- source_image\_url: a link to the image from which the question/insight has been deduced;

#### Negative result
When the API-call does not result in any questions, the following json is returned. In this json the **status**-field has the value **no_questions**::
```
{
  "questions": [
    {}
  ],
  "status": "no_questions"
}
```
### Insight types
The insight type, i.e. the subject the question is about, can have the following values. These values are converted to the enum InsightType
- **brand**: extracts the product's brand from the image OCR.
- **category**: predicts the category of a product.
- **expiration_date**: extracts the expiration date from the image OCR.
- **image_orientation**: predicts the image orientation of the given image.
- **ingredient_spellcheck**: corrects the spelling in the given ingredients list.
- **image_flag**: flags inappropriate images based on OCR text.
- **image_lang**: detects which languages are mentioned on the product from the image OCR.
- **label**: predicts a label that appears on the product packaging photo.
- **location**: the location of where the product comes from from the image OCR.
- **nutrient**: the list of nutrients mentioned in a product, alongside their numeric value from the image OCR.
- **nutrient_mention**: mentions of nutrients from the image OCR (without actual values).
- **nutrition_image**: tags images that have nutrition information based on the 'nutrient_mention' insight and the 'image_orientation' insight.
- **nutrition_table_structure**: detects the nutritional table structure from the image.
- **packaging**: detects the type of packaging based on the image OCR.
- **product_weight**: extracts the product weight from the image OCR.
- **store**: the store where the given product is sold from the image OCR.
- **trace**: detects traces that are present in the product from the image OCR.
